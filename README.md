# General Offline Paradigm (GoPar)

A paradigm handler program for Brain-Computer Interface.

## Description

This project is originally designed for the BCI discipline of the Cybathlon 2020 competition by the Ebrainers.
The code can be used for leading different types of paradigms. 

## Installation

1. Download git project
2. install MATLAB
3. download and install [Psychtoolbox](http://psychtoolbox.org/)

## Usage

Start MATLAB and run the `paradigm.m` script

## Citing

Having instructions for running tests is especially helpful if it requires external setup, such as starting a Selenium server for testing in a browser.)
